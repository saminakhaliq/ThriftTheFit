## Inspiration
We wanted to find a good way to make fashion more accessible and eco-friendly at the same time. The fast fashion industry generates a lot of packaging and clothing waste, so we wanted to find a more sustainable alternative to conventional online shopping.
## What it does
Our site allows the user to browse items sold at local thrift shops as well as those posted for sale by another user. We included a weather check feature that suggests appropriate clothing for the season and weather. Finally, there is a Mix and Match tab that allows the user to build the perfect outfit using clothes from local vendors.
## How we built it
Thrift the Fit is hosted on Firebase and a large portion is coded in C#. Building off a website template, we added pages and functionality in HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
## Challenges we ran into
The carousel feature of the Mix and Match page was particularly difficult to implement. We also struggled to enable the geolocator for the weather check feature.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The carousel viewer was difficult to get right, so getting that right was particularly satisfying. In addition, integrating the multiple parts of the web app took some testing and constant tweaking, so the whole site working together is a welcome sight :)
## What's next for Thrift the Fit
We plan to add some more options for the individual user. We would implement user accounts with simple password protection. Each user will be able to add their own personal wardrobe to painlessly choose an outfit for any occasion.
